    <p>I have just created a folder in my workspace for my work for this assignment
To do this I created a folder called arch assignment and inside this folder I created another folder called pictures I have just created a screenshot to prove this
<img src="pictures/folder of my work.png" >

I have now learnt about terminal and found a quick short cut for it I have done this by right clicking the folder I want it to be pointed to and pressed open with terminal this opened terminal and pointed it to the folder I want I then did git init
<img src="pictures/Terminal.png" >


I have now just created my git hub repository I have done this by logging on to GitHub clicking on the green button new and naming my repository correctly and choosing the correct settings for my assignment

<img src="pictures/Git hub repository.png" >

I have linked my local repository to git hub I have done this through the terminal with these commands git remote add origin https://github.com/Kingnugget10101/ARCHOSC-Assignment-JakeRecord.git
git pull origin main


this allows me to easily upload my work to the repository and also get my work



I have created my website using visual studio I have done this with html code and put it into my workspace folder and named t index with the file name extension html

<img src="pictures/My website.png" >

I have just committed and uploaded my work to git hub I have done that with git commit command and uploaded a picture to my work folder


I have just pushed my work to the GitHub repository and taken a picture I have done this buy using the terminal and git push u -origin main

I have changed my website twice I have done this by changing the name on the website (the title) I have also changed the background colour for the website I have documented these with pictures in my work folder
<img src="pictures/Change 1.png" >
<img src="pictures/Change 2.png" >
<img src="pictures/work proof changes.png" >
I just linked my website in GitHub this means you can press deployments on git hub and see a direct link to my website this allows for easy access to the website
